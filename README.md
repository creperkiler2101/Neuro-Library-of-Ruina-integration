# Neuro-Library-of-Ruina-integration
Mod based on BepInEx for Library of Ruina that allows [Neuro-sama](https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987) play the game. 

Mod uses [NeuroGameSdk](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk)

[UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask) was compiled locally for net framework 4.7.2, same for [NativeWebSocket](https://github.com/endel/NativeWebSocket) (Included in NeuroSdk.dll)

Currently neuro can:
* Play cards
* Play EGO cards
* Select abnormality pages
* Select EGO cards
* Remove played card
* End turn
All of this should allow neuro to fully complete battle by herself

Things to do:
* Deck building
* Passive transfering
* Invitation selection
* Cutscene reading
* Floor selection (In invitation)
* Book burning (Mb its better to use no grind mod instead?)
* Abnormality fight selection
* Realisation selection
