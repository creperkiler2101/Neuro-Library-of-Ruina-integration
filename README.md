# Neuro-Library-of-Ruina-integration
Mod based on BepInEx for Library of Ruina that allows [Neuro-sama](https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987) play the game. 

Mod uses [NeuroGameSdk](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk)

[UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask) was compiled locally for net framework 4.7.2, same for [NativeWebSocket](https://github.com/endel/NativeWebSocket) (Included in NeuroSdk.dll)

Currently neuro can only play cards in a battle, ill add later ability to choose abnormality cards, EGO cards, ability to create decks & passive transferring, etc.
